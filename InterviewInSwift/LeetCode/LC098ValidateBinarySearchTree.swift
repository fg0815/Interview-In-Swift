 98. Validate Binary Search Tree
 https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/
 
 Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
 
 Assume a BST is defined as follows:
 
 The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
 The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 Example 1:
   2
  / \
 1   3
 Binary tree [2,1,3], return true.
 Example 2:
   1
  / \
 2   3
 Binary tree [1,2,3], return false.
